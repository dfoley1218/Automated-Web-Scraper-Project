This project is an automated web scraper designed to fetch and display the current price of Bitcoin from CoinMarketCap. Built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, it leverages the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to extract real-time cryptocurrency data efficiently.

Features
Real-Time Data Fetching: Retrieves the latest Bitcoin price from CoinMarketCap.

Lightweight and Efficient: Uses minimal dependencies for quick execution.

Easy to Customize: The code can be adapted to scrape other cryptocurrencies or additional data points.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the scraper.

BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting data.

Requests: To send HTTP requests and fetch web content.

Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for development and testing.

How It Works
The script sends a request to the CoinMarketCap Bitcoin page.
